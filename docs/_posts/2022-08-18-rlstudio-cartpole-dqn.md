This month we focused on the two following goals:
- Making my RTX GeForce 3080 work successfully. Tensorflow did not work as expected, so Pytorch was chosen as the GPU deep RL framework to use
- Solve the cartpole classic openAiGym proposed problem in RL-Studio now using DQN and making the solution more stable

Due to this integration, the rl-studio project has been refactored.
Additionally, a new DQN algorithm and its corresponding cartpole dqn-related problem was added to enable its further refinement.
