This month we focused on the following goals:
- Solve cartpole with 4 different algorithms and illustrate their performance with video and charts in [post](https://roboticslaburjc.github.io/2020-phd-ruben-lucas/projects/2022-11-07-Added_PPO_To_RLStudio_cartpole_algorithms_comparison/)
- analyse and present the paper [End-to-End Model-Free Reinforcement Learning for Urban Driving using Implicit Affordances](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10868v2.pdf)
  - [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1csjozm8XuXJad4CLJyXq_H-JEHGatdJ5/view?usp=sharing)
- analyse and present the paper [Reinforcement Learning-Based Autonomous Driving at Intersections in CARLA Simulator](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/21/8373/pdf)
