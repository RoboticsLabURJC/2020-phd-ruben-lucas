The goal of this two weeks is to have an homogeneus project structure and an easy to follow projects
coding plan (unwritten guidelines) so all of the exercises are organized in the same way.
Additionally, the introdction, QLearning and Sarsa sections of the sutton book have been reviewed besides the other sources included in "lectures" section.
