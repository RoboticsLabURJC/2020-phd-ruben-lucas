This month we focused on the two following goals:
- Include openAiGym simulator among the RL-Studio supported simulators
- Solve the cartpole classic openAiGym proposed problem in RL-Studio
- Go beyond the cartpole proposed problem and customize the environment to get better achievements

Due to this integration, the rl-studio project has been refactored.
Additionally, a new DQN algorithm and its corresponding cartpole dqn-related problem was added to enable its further refinement.
