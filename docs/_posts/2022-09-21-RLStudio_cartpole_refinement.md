This month we focused on the two following goals:
- Make cartpole learning stable enough making use of DQN, adaptative learning and replay buffers
- Investigate about reward policies alternatives and some ways to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
- Include monitorization to cartpole to know how solid is our solution (TODO include this monitorization as a common library in RL-Studio)

- you can see more details about the projec status in [cartpole project post](https://roboticslaburjc.github.io/2020-phd-ruben-lucas/projects/2022-09-21-RLStudio_cartpole_refinement/)
