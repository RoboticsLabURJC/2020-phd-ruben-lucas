We finally integrated the problems into the RLStudio version 1.1.
For tat purpose, the following tasks were accomplished:
- Code cleaning using python black module
- Code refactors to enable rlstudio to integrate different problems without affecting the code (just configuration). It includes some new configuration parameters, algorithms and environments homogeneization and installation scrips fixes.
- New problems documentation and new videos added in [Mountain car](https://roboticslaburjc.github.io/2020-phd-ruben-lucas/projects/2022-01-07-RLStudio_mountain_car/) and  [robot-mesh](https://roboticslaburjc.github.io/2020-phd-ruben-lucas/projects/2021-07-26-RLStudio_robotmesh/) blogs
- gh-pages update of rl-studio documentation branch to ilustrate this new version
