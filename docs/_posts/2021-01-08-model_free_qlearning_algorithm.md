The goal of this month is defining from scratch a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm and an environment to solve a typical path learning from source to goal problem. Additionally, some lectures have been useful to accomplish the month objective.

## Lectures

- [Reinforcement learning algorithms overview](https://medium.com/@SmartLabAI/reinforcement-learning-algorithms-an-intuitive-overview-904e2dff5bbc)

- [When to choose sarsa vs qlearning](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/326788/when-to-choose-sarsa-vs-q-learning#:~:text=In%20Q%20learning%2C%20you%20update,and%20take%20the%20same%20action.)

- [Temporal difference learning](https://medium.com/@violante.andre/simple-reinforcement-learning-temporal-difference-learning-e883ea0d65b0)
