These two months we focused on writing the first rl-studio article.
The event for which it was written is [the iberia robot2022 conference](https://www.iberianroboticsconf.eu/).
While writting the article we realized that there were some points in rl-studio problems that needed to be refined.
Those points were the following:

- Add robot mesh monitoring metrics
- Add mountain car monitoring metrics
- Improve the mountain car problem performance so the results are conclusive
- F1 simple circuit training-inference trial and metrics

So, this two months the efforts were focused on covering those gaps and filling the rl-studio paper with the final outcomes.
Additionally, it was our first experience writing a real article with latex and overleaf 

That said, besides the rl-studio code tunnings, the released article can be found in [my rl-studio repository](https://github.com/rubenlucas93/2020-phd-ruben-lucas/tree/master/RL_Unibotics/RL-Studio/)
