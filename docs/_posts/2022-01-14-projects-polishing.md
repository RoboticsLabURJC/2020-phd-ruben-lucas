We are about to integrate the robot mesh and mountain car into RL-Studio 1.1.0, so no new problems will be addressed.
However, while revisitting the problems and algorithms already integrated into RL-Studio 0.1.0 (Note that the review was needed
because I came back from a job movement and I needed to pull all the repositories and reinstall the environment again) some
bugsfixes and improvements in "mountain_car" and minor code cleaning in "robot_mesh" were performed.


## Lectures

- First week of [coursera princeton algorithms course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/)

## Lab work

- The modifications and more relevant adjustments of the mountain_car problem have been documented in its [q_learning analysis report](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2020-phd-ruben-lucas/tree/master/RL_Unibotics/RL-Studio/results/mountain_car/results.docx).
