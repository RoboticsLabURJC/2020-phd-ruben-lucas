I"¼<p>The goal of this month is to finally get a tangible work for robot_mesh problem.
In previous weeks, a robot was trained using qlearning to learn how to run from an origin to a destination
skiping some obstacles in the shortest path posible. Now, this problem has been migrated to not only get the statistics,
but also visualize the training and inference of this robot.
Additionally, the RL-Studio installation manual has been updated to skip some errors.
By the way, the computer bought last month is not yet readyâ€¦ Dealing with swindlers.</p>
