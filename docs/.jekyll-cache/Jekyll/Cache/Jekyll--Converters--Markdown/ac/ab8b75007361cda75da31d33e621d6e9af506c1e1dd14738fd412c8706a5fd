I"¬<p>The goal of this month is to fully read the first section of sutton book (8 chapters) and to fully understand
the basics of reincorcement learning. Once we got enough background, it will be easier to follow the good practices
and state-of-the-art of reinforcement learning. Additionally, since more algorithms will be known, more tools will
be at our hands so we can achieve better results for each one of the exercises and projects that will be accomplished.</p>

<p>Additionally, to prove the know-how improvement, the mountain car exercise developed in previous posts will be revisited
and redesigned to achieve better results either modifying the current proposed algorithm or using a more suitable one.</p>

<h2 id="lectures">Lectures</h2>

<p>Since the work of this month consisted of learning from the sutton book referenced in <a href="https://roboticslaburjc.github.io/2020-phd-ruben-lucas/about/">resources section</a>, what we are gathering in this section is a summary of headlines with the key lessons learned from this reading. (Note that there were some lessons already learned in previous iterations and note also that a summary of all the lessons learned in each chapter are provided in the book in the last item of every chapter).</p>
