I"N<p>The goal of this month is to get in touch with gazebo and rl-studio in order to later work with this and develop our own artifial intelligence models making use of all the gazebo benefits.
Since these two months have been quite chaotic (vacations + computer fault) the progress to show is basically none. Hopefully it will ramp up soon because we will be working with a new PHD mate (Pedro) from now on. 
And last but not least. This week we got a new TOP computer with the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>RAM - 32GB DDR4 3200Mhz</li>
  <li>HARD DISK DRIVE - HDD 2TB</li>
  <li>SOLID STATE DRIVE - SSD m.2 NVME 500GB</li>
  <li>CPU - AMD Ryzen7 5800X</li>
  <li>GPU - RTX 6800 rx</li>
</ul>
