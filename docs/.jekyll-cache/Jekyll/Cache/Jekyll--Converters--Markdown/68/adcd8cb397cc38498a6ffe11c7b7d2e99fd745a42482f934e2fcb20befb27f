I"œ<p>We are about to integrate the robot mesh and mountain car into RL-Studio 1.1.0, so no new problems will be addressed.
However, while revisitting the problems and algorithms already integrated into RL-Studio 0.1.0 (Note that the review was needed
because I came back from a job movement and I needed to pull all the repositories and reinstall the environment again) some
bugsfixes and improvements in ‚Äúmountain_car‚Äù and minor code cleaning in ‚Äúrobot_mesh‚Äù were performed.</p>
